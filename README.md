# PRINTF PROJECT READ ME

**Project Overview :**
This project is mainly about creating a clone of the C-programming language's printf function.

The printf project also takes into consideration of testing our knowledge on how we grasped some basic and advanced concepts in the C-programming language.
It however teaches how to collaborate with partners and work in groups to be able to get a problem solved.
