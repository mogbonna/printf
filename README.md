# PRINTF PROJECT READ ME

**Project Overview :**
This project is mainly about creating a clone of the C-programming language's printf function.

The printf project also takes into consideration of testing our knowledge on how we grasped some basic and advanced concepts in the C-programming language.
It however teaches how to collaborate with partners and work in groups to be able to get a problem solved.

### git_auto
[This](https://github.com/mogbonna/printf/blob/main/git_auto)file automates the git process.
-git add
-git commit -m ""
-git push

The git add in this file adds all updated or created files to staging, It then ask for user commit message and uses that as your commit message.
After entering your commit message, it commits then pushes your current commit to the origin or remote repository.

**NB:** If is fails to push to the remote repository due to problems with network problems, just `git push` again when you get a stable network and it will work just fine.
